## Coursera - Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments
## University of Colorado Boulder

Contains my courseware for the [Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments by University of Colorado Boulder taught on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems/home/welcome)

### Week 1 C1M1
create a simple application that performs statistical analytics on a dataset. This assignment will help you get re-oriented with c-programming syntax and host machine compilation. 

### Week 2 C1M2
In this programming assignment i create a build system using the GNU tools, GCC and GNU Make.compile multiple files, link them together and create a final output executable that support two platforms: the host environment and the target embedded system MSP432.

### Week 3 C1M3 
analyzing some allocated memory using the GCC toolchain
provide detailsabout  specific symbol elements including:
* Location Top segment or Type - Code, Data, Peripheral, Register, None
* Location Sub-segment - Stack, Heap, BSS, Data, const/rodata, None
* Access Permissions  - Read (R), Write (W) Read-write (RW), None
* Lifetime - Function/Block, Program, Indefinite, None

### Course1 final_assessment
Expanded Build System and Memory
## Goals
* Incorporate a c-program application into your Make and GCC build system
* Write c-program functions that manipulate memory
* Execute and test your application by simulating it on the host machine
